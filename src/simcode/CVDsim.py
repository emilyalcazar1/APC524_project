Based on J. Emery's adaptation of A Kinetic Monte Carlo method for the
atomic-scale simulation of chemical vapor deposition: Application to diamond.
Journal of Applied Physics, 82(12), 6293â€“6300. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.366532

Call CVDsim(nsites, timesteps, hmax) to run

Inputs:
  nsites: Number of sites on the substrate surface where growth can occur
  timesteps: Number of time steps for the reaction to occur
  hmax: Maximum height material growth can reach (simulation will terminate)
  reac: An array of the activity for each chemical species (Defined
         inside the function)

Outputs:
  tot: An array of size [nsites x hmax] of the most recent timestep
  tottime: An array of size [(nsites x hmax) x (timesteps + 1)] that compiles 
            the tot matrix for each timestep
  height: Array of material height at each site
  species: Array of chemical species at each site
  time: An arry of size [(timesteps + 1) x 1] of the time
  totact: An array of size [(timesteps + 1) x 1] that compiles the overall
           surface activity over time
  aveh: An array of size [(timesteps + 1) x 1] that gives the 
        average height of the system at each timestep

     This function simulates the chemical vapor deposition, a method of material
